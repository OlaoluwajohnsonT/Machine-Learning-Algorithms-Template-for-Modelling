# Machine Learning Template Repository

This repository contains templates for various machine learning tasks, including regression and classification models. These templates are designed to provide a starting point for your machine learning projects, allowing you to quickly set up your environment and begin experimenting with different algorithms and datasets.
Overview

    Regression Models: This folder contains templates for building regression models. Regression is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous value.

    Classification Models: This folder contains templates for building classification models. Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the class label of input data.

# Getting Started

To use these templates, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the Desired Template: Navigate to the folder containing the template for the task you're working on (e.g., Regression or Classification).

Set Up Your Environment: Set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Explore the Template: Take a look at the provided template files to understand the structure and organization of the project.

    Start Building: Start building your machine learning model by modifying the template files and adding your own code.
